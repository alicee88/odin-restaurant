# Restaurant

An Odin project to practice HTML/CSS/JS

The purpose of this project was to dynamically create pages using Javascript modules and Webpack to bundle them.

Importing and exporting modules was pretty straightforward, and it was helpful to use Webpack's watch functionality to monitor for changes without having to rebuild main.js each time.
